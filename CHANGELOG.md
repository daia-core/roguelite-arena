# Roguelite Arena — Changelog

Newest first. One block per production deploy: player-visible changes first, the commit sha,
and the live-build verification (Felix plays on his phone — every entry is verified at a mobile
portrait viewport).

## 2026-07-02 — Menu polish + favicon

**Player-visible**
- Menu subtitle ("BUILD A BROKEN BUILD IN THE SHOP. SURVIVE.") no longer clips off the right
  edge on narrow portrait phones — long menu lines now auto-shrink to fit the screen width.
- Browser tab now shows the game favicon instead of a broken-icon / `/favicon.ico` 404.

**Under the hood**
- `Renderer.drawText`: new `maxWidth` option measures the (wide) pixel font via
  `ctx.measureText` and scales the size down to fit — reusable for any future long copy.
- `Game.drawMenu`: passes `maxWidth = canvas.width − s(24)` to the four long menu lines.
- `index.html`: `<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg">` (favicon.svg
  already shipped in `public/`).

**Commit** `179be6a`
**Live verified** JS hash `index-CeQHY5_n.js` served at prod; `/favicon.svg` → 200; portrait
menu screenshot shows the subtitle fully on-screen; portrait shop still purchasable via the
touch path (gold 500→491, bought Iron Ring, 0 console errors).

## 2026-07-02 — Art & UX overhaul + balance (host session)

**Player-visible**
- Full art/UX overhaul: camera scale, 38 redrawn sprites, pixel-art wood UI buttons (replacing
  the old green/purple gradient), enemy fire patterns.
- Sim-verified balance pass: wave pacing + economy, speed cap, flat gold, boss enrage, duo
  surfacing; placebo item & meta effects wired.
- Portrait shop cards are clickable (the hi-DPI touch-hitbox misalignment was fixed).

**Commits** `de31c19` (art/UX) · `0854114` + `72d8f5a` (balance) · `9462c36` (live QA harness)
**Live verified** deployed via Vercel CLI; live JS hash matched the local build; portrait shop
purchase confirmed end-to-end via headless touch QA.
